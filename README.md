# InterMeas
An R Shiny dashboard wrapping a few python scripts and object detection algorithms into an easy to use internode measurment workflow.

TODO:
* add progress bars to appropriate section (cropping, yolo annotating, prep, and Internodal measurements)
* add slickR to visulize outputs during final internodal measurement step
* write tutorial on how to go from input images to final output
* add VCA plots back into results section
* upload minimal anaconda environment setup file
* add link to labelImg usage
* make tutorial on how to use shinyshortcut to make things point and click
* move outputs into a dedicated output folder
* add references to labelimg/anaconda/yolo
* add analysis to measure importance of internode lengths in predicting maize phenotypes
* add function to clean potential erronous annotations from periphery of image
